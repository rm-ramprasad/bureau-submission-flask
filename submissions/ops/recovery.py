"""Recover from crashed or killed workers. Runs at the start of every worker poll (cheap queries).

- RUNNING rows older than `run_timeout` go back to PENDING, or FAILED once `max_attempts` is reached.
- Snapshots stuck in BUILDING/EXTRACTED longer than `build_timeout` are failed and their rows removed,
  so a retried row can rebuild them.
